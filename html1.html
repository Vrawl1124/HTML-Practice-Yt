            [Verse 1]
            Party girls don't get hurt
            Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
            I push it down, I push it down
            I'm the one for a good time call
            Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
            I feel the love, I feel the love


            [Pre-Chorus]
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            Throw 'em back 'til I lose count


            [Chorus]
            I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
            From the chandelier
            I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
            Like it doesn't exist
            I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
            Feel my tears as they dry
            I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
            From the chandelier


            [Post-Chorus]
            But I'm holdin' on for dear life
            Won't look down, won't open my eyes
            Keep my glass full until mornin' light
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
            Won't look down, won't open my eyes
            Keep my glass full until mornin' light
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

            [Verse 2]
            Sun is up, I'm a mess
            Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
            Here comes the shame, here comes the shame (Ahh)


            [Pre-Chorus]
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
            Throw 'em back 'til I lose count


            [Chorus]
            I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
            From the chandelier
            I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
            Like it doesn't exist
            I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
            Feel my tears as they dry
            I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
            From the chandelier


            [Post-Chorus]
            But I'm holdin' on for dear life
            Won't look down, won't open my eyes
            Keep my glass full until mornin' light
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
            Won't look down, won't open my eyes
            Keep my glass full until mornin' light
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight


            [Outro]
            On for tonight
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            On for tonight, on for tonight
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
            On for tonight, on for tonight
